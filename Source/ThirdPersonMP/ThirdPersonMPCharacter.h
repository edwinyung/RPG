	//These are the variables and functions we will be using to fire our projectiles. HandleFire is the only RPC we will implement in this tutorial, and it will be responsible for spawning projectiles on the server. Because it has the Server specifier, any attempt to call it on a client will result in the call being directed over the network to the authoritative Character on the server instead. Because HandleFire has the Reliable specifier as well, it is placed into a queue for reliable RPCs whenever it gets called, and it is removed from the queue when the server successfully receives it.This guarnatees that the server will definitely receive this function call.However, the queue for reliable RPCs can overflow if too many RPCs are placed into it at once without removing them, and if it does then it will force the user to disconnect.Therefore, we need to be cautious in how often we allow players to call this function.
